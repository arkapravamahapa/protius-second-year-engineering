# Analog Electronics Circuit Simulations for Proteus

This repository is a collection of basic analog electronics circuits designed and simulated using **Proteus Design Suite**. It includes common operational amplifier (op-amp) configurations and rectifier circuits, serving as a practical resource for students and hobbyists learning electronics simulation.

##  circuits Included

The repository contains the following Proteus project files (`.pdsprj`):

### 1. Operational Amplifier (Op-Amp) Circuits
* **`inverting and non inverting.pdsprj`**: Demonstrates the two fundamental amplifier configurations.
* **`integrator.pdsprj`**: A circuit that performs the mathematical operation of integration (converts a square wave to a triangle wave).
* **`differentiator.4p.pdsprj`**: A circuit that performs the mathematical operation of differentiation (converts a triangle wave to a square wave).
* **`schmitt trigger.pdsprj`**: A comparator circuit with hysteresis, used to convert noisy analog signals into clean digital signals.

### 2. Rectifier Circuits
* **`with half wave.pdsprj` & `with out half wave.pdsprj`**: Demonstrates a half-wave rectifier circuit, showing the output waveform both with and without a smoothing filter capacitor.
* **`with full wave.pdsprj` & `with out full wave.pdsprj`**: Demonstrates a full-wave bridge rectifier circuit, showing the output waveform both with and without a smoothing filter capacitor.

## 💻 Software Required

To open and run these simulations, you must have **Proteus Design Suite** (Version 8 or later is recommended) installed on your computer.

## 🚀 How to Use

1.  **Clone or Download:** Clone this repository or download the `.pdsprj` file you are interested in.
2.  **Open:** Open the project file (e.g., `integrator.pdsprj`) using Proteus.
3.  **Run Simulation:** Click the "Play" button in the Proteus interface to run the simulation.
4.  **Observe:** Use the virtual instruments (like the oscilloscope or voltmeter) already included in the circuits to observe the behavior and waveforms.
